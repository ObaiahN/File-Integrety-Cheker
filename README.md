## RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
A File Integrity Checker is a security tool used to verify that files have not been altered, tampered with, or corrupted. It works by generating and storing cryptographic hashes (like SHA-256) of files at a known good state and later comparing those hashes to detect unauthorized changes.

This tool is commonly used in cybersecurity, system administration, and software deployment to ensure data integrity and prevent breaches caused by malware or unauthorized access.
- Store the hash database in a secure location,
- Use SHA-256 or SHA-3 instead of MD5,
- Schedule automatic integrity checks (e.g., using cron),
- Monitor the checker script itself for tampering.
